# 🚀 Override Branch Validation Guide

## Overview

The `override_branch_validation` parameter provides a **controlled way** to deploy applications to any environment from any branch, bypassing the standard branch protection rules. This feature is essential for emergency deployments, hotfixes, and testing scenarios while maintaining a **complete audit trail**.

## 🔒 **How Branch Validation Works**

### **Standard Branch Protection Rules**

Each environment has **strict branch requirements** for automatic deployments:

| Environment | Allowed Branches | Auto-Deploy Triggers |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **DEV** | `dev`, `develop` | Push to dev/develop branches |
| **SQE** | `sqe` | Push to sqe branch |
| **PPR** | `release/*` | Push to release branches |
| **PROD** | `refs/tags/*` | Push tags (e.g., v1.0.0) |

### **Manual Deployment Behavior**

When using **workflow dispatch** (manual deployment):

#### **✅ From Authorized Branch**
```bash
# Example: Deploying to DEV from dev branch
Branch: refs/heads/dev
Environment: dev
Override: false (not needed)

Result: ✅ "Dev deployment approved: dev branch"
```

#### **❌ From Unauthorized Branch (No Override)**
```bash
# Example: Deploying to DEV from main branch
Branch: refs/heads/main
Environment: dev  
Override: false

Result: ❌ "Dev deployment blocked: workflow_dispatch from non-dev branch requires override"
       📍 "Current branch: refs/heads/main"
       ✅ "To deploy: Check 'Override branch validation' option"
```

#### **✅ From Unauthorized Branch (With Override)**
```bash
# Example: Deploying to DEV from main branch with override
Branch: refs/heads/main
Environment: dev
Override: true

Result: ✅ "Dev deployment approved: manual override from branch refs/heads/main"
       🚨 "Branch validation overridden by: john.doe"
```

## 🎯 **When to Use Override**

### **✅ Appropriate Use Cases**

1. **Emergency Hotfixes**
   - Critical production issues requiring immediate deployment
   - Security patches that can't wait for normal release cycle
   - Urgent bug fixes affecting user experience

2. **Testing & Development**
   - Testing deployment workflow from feature branches
   - Validating changes in specific environments
   - Development team testing integration

3. **Special Circumstances**
   - Release branch not available yet but deployment needed
   - Rollback scenarios requiring specific commit deployment
   - Cross-environment testing requirements

### **❌ Inappropriate Use Cases**

1. **Regular Development Flow**
   - Normal feature development should use proper branches
   - Routine deployments should follow standard process

2. **Convenience Shortcuts**
   - Avoiding proper git workflow
   - Bypassing code review processes

3. **Unauthorized Access**
   - Users without proper deployment permissions
   - Deployments without proper approval

## 🔧 **How to Use Override**

### **Via GitHub UI (Workflow Dispatch)**

1. **Navigate to Actions Tab**
   ```
   Repository → Actions → Deploy Java Backend 1 → Run workflow
   ```

2. **Configure Deployment**
   ```yaml
   Environment: [Select target environment]
   Force deployment: false
   Override branch validation: ✅ [Check this box]  # ← Enable override
   Custom image tag: [Optional]
   Deployment notes: "Emergency hotfix for issue #123"  # ← Required for audit
   ```

3. **Review and Deploy**
   - Verify all settings are correct
   - Ensure deployment notes explain the reason
   - Click "Run workflow"

### **Via GitHub CLI**

```bash
# Deploy to DEV from any branch with override
gh workflow run deploy.yml \
  -f environment=dev \
  -f override_branch_validation=true \
  -f deploy_notes="Emergency hotfix deployment"

# Deploy to PROD from any branch with override (requires notes)
gh workflow run deploy.yml \
  -f environment=prod \
  -f override_branch_validation=true \
  -f deploy_notes="Critical security patch - approved by CTO"
```

### **Via REST API**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/dispatches \
  -d '{
    "ref": "main",
    "inputs": {
      "environment": "dev",
      "override_branch_validation": "true",
      "deploy_notes": "Emergency deployment from main branch"
    }
  }'
```

## 📋 **Environment-Specific Override Behavior**

### **DEV Environment**
```yaml
Standard Branches: dev, develop
Override Behavior:
  - ✅ Allows deployment from any branch
  - 📝 Logs override usage and user
  - ⚡ No additional approvals required
  - 🔍 Audit trail maintained
```

### **SQE Environment**
```yaml
Standard Branches: sqe
Override Behavior:
  - ✅ Allows deployment from any branch
  - 📝 Logs override usage and user
  - ⚡ No additional approvals required
  - 🔍 Audit trail maintained
```

### **PPR (Pre-Production) Environment**
```yaml
Standard Branches: release/*
Override Behavior:
  - ✅ Allows deployment from any branch
  - 📝 Logs override usage and user
  - ⚠️ Consider additional approvals for production-like environment
  - 🔍 Enhanced audit trail maintained
```

### **PROD (Production) Environment**
```yaml
Standard Branches: refs/tags/* (tagged releases)
Override Behavior:
  - ✅ Allows deployment from any branch
  - 📝 Deployment notes REQUIRED for audit compliance
  - 🚨 CRITICAL: Override usage prominently logged
  - 👥 Consider requiring additional authorization
  - 🔍 Full audit trail with user attribution
```

## 🛡️ **Security Considerations**

### **Audit Trail Features**

1. **User Attribution**
   ```
   🚨 Branch validation overridden by: john.doe
   ```

2. **Branch Information**
   ```
   📍 Current branch: refs/heads/main
   ```

3. **Deployment Notes**
   ```
   📝 Deployment Notes: Emergency hotfix for security vulnerability
   ```

4. **Timestamp & Context**
   - Full GitHub Actions run logs
   - Commit SHA and branch information
   - Environment and deployment details

### **Best Practices**

1. **Always Provide Deployment Notes**
   ```yaml
   deploy_notes: "Detailed reason for override deployment"
   # Examples:
   # - "Emergency hotfix for CVE-2024-xxxx"
   # - "Critical production issue - approved by incident commander"
   # - "Testing deployment workflow from feature branch"
   ```

2. **Document Override Usage**
   - Include ticket/issue references
   - Mention approval source (incident commander, CTO, etc.)
   - Explain why standard process couldn't be followed

3. **Monitor Override Usage**
   - Regular review of override deployments
   - Alert on frequent override usage
   - Investigate unexpected override patterns

## 📊 **Monitoring & Alerting**

### **Recommended Monitoring**

1. **Override Usage Tracking**
   ```bash
   # Search for override deployments in logs
   grep "Branch validation overridden by" workflow-logs.txt
   ```

2. **Production Override Alerts**
   ```yaml
   # Alert on any production override
   if: environment == 'prod' && override_branch_validation == 'true'
   ```

3. **Frequent Override Detection**
   ```bash
   # Track override frequency per user
   grep "overridden by:" logs | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
   ```

### **Audit Reports**

Generate regular reports showing:
- Override usage by environment
- Override usage by user
- Deployment notes and justifications
- Success/failure rates for override deployments

## 🧪 **Testing Override Functionality**

### **Test Scenarios**

1. **Valid Override Test**
   ```bash
   # Test: Deploy to DEV from main branch WITH override
   Branch: main
   Environment: dev
   Override: true
   Expected: ✅ Success with override message
   ```

2. **Invalid No-Override Test**
   ```bash
   # Test: Deploy to DEV from main branch WITHOUT override
   Branch: main
   Environment: dev
   Override: false
   Expected: ❌ Failure with clear error message
   ```

3. **Normal Deployment Test**
   ```bash
   # Test: Deploy to DEV from dev branch without override
   Branch: dev
   Environment: dev
   Override: false
   Expected: ✅ Success with normal approval message
   ```

### **Production Validation**

Before using in production:

1. **Test all environments** (dev, sqe, ppr, prod)
2. **Verify error messages** are clear and helpful
3. **Confirm audit logging** works correctly
4. **Validate user attribution** is captured
5. **Test with different branch patterns**

## 📚 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Override Not Working**
   ```
   Issue: Deployment still fails even with override=true
   Solution: Check deployment notes are provided (required for prod)
   Verification: Look for deployment notes in error message
   ```

2. **Unclear Error Messages**
   ```
   Issue: Error doesn't explain why deployment was blocked
   Solution: Check current branch matches expected pattern
   Verification: Look for "Current branch:" in error output
   ```

3. **Missing Audit Trail**
   ```
   Issue: Override usage not logged properly
   Solution: Verify workflow is using latest shared-deploy.yml
   Verification: Look for "Branch validation overridden by:" in logs
   ```

### **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Check environment configuration
grep -A 10 "case.*TARGET_ENV" .github/workflows/shared-deploy.yml

# Verify override logic
grep -A 20 "OVERRIDE_VALIDATION" .github/workflows/shared-deploy.yml
```

## 🎯 **Summary**

The `override_branch_validation` parameter provides **secure, auditable branch protection bypass** for legitimate use cases while maintaining:

- ✅ **Complete Audit Trail**: Every override is logged with user attribution
- ✅ **Clear Error Messages**: Users know exactly when and why to use override
- ✅ **Security Controls**: Override usage is prominently flagged and monitored
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Supports emergency deployments and testing scenarios
- ✅ **Compliance**: Deployment notes ensure proper documentation

**Remember**: Override is a **powerful feature** that should be used **responsibly** with **proper documentation** and **appropriate justification**.
