# Deployment Security Guide

This guide explains the multi-layered security approach for protecting production deployments while maintaining development flexibility.

## Overview

The deployment system implements three levels of protection:
- **Standard Protection**: DEV and SQE environments (minimal restrictions)
- **Enhanced Protection**: PPR environment (authorized users only for overrides)
- **Maximum Protection**: PROD environment (authorized users + emergency flag for overrides)

## Authorized Users Configuration

### Where to Configure

The authorized users list is configured in the shared workflow file:
**File**: `.github/workflows/shared-deploy.yml` (in `no-keyvault-shared-github-actions` branch)

**Location**: Line ~75 in the `validate-environment` job, within the shell script section:

```yaml
- name: Validate deployment environment and set cluster details
  shell: bash
  run: |
    # ... other code ...
    
    # Authorized users list (configurable)
    AUTHORIZED_USERS="admin,devops-lead,release-manager,platform-engineer"
    
    # ... rest of the script ...
```

### How to Modify Authorized Users

#### 1. Edit the Shared Workflow

To add or remove authorized users, modify the `AUTHORIZED_USERS` variable:

```bash
# Current configuration
AUTHORIZED_USERS="admin,devops-lead,release-manager,platform-engineer"

# Example: Add new users
AUTHORIZED_USERS="admin,devops-lead,release-manager,platform-engineer,senior-dev,qa-lead"

# Example: Remove a user
AUTHORIZED_USERS="admin,devops-lead,release-manager"

# Example: Single administrator
AUTHORIZED_USERS="admin"
```

#### 2. User Identification Format

Users are identified by their **GitHub username** (not display name or email).

**Examples:**
```bash
# Correct: GitHub usernames
AUTHORIZED_USERS="john.doe,jane.smith,mike.wilson"

# Incorrect: Email addresses
AUTHORIZED_USERS="john@company.com,jane@company.com"  # ‚ùå Won't work

# Incorrect: Display names
AUTHORIZED_USERS="John Doe,Jane Smith"  # ‚ùå Won't work
```

#### 3. Configuration Examples

**Small Team Configuration:**
```bash
AUTHORIZED_USERS="tech-lead,devops-admin"
```

**Medium Team Configuration:**
```bash
AUTHORIZED_USERS="admin,devops-lead,release-manager,platform-engineer,senior-dev-1,senior-dev-2"
```

**Enterprise Configuration:**
```bash
AUTHORIZED_USERS="platform-admin,devops-manager,release-director,infrastructure-lead,security-engineer,production-operator"
```

**Emergency-Only Configuration:**
```bash
AUTHORIZED_USERS="emergency-admin"
```

### Best Practices for User Management

#### 1. Role-Based Authorization

Organize users by responsibility:

```bash
# Production Operations Team
AUTHORIZED_USERS="prod-ops-lead,infrastructure-manager,platform-engineer,devops-senior"

# Release Management Team  
AUTHORIZED_USERS="release-manager,deployment-lead,qa-director,product-owner"

# Emergency Response Team
AUTHORIZED_USERS="on-call-engineer,site-reliability-lead,platform-architect"
```

#### 2. Principle of Least Privilege

- **Minimum Required**: Only include users who regularly need to perform protected deployments
- **Regular Review**: Audit the list quarterly to remove inactive users
- **Emergency Access**: Maintain at least 2-3 authorized users for emergency scenarios

#### 3. User Lifecycle Management

**Adding New Users:**
1. Verify GitHub username spelling
2. Test with a non-production override first
3. Document the addition in team records

**Removing Users:**
1. Remove from `AUTHORIZED_USERS` list
2. Verify removal with a test deployment
3. Update team documentation

#### 4. Security Considerations

**GitHub Username Verification:**
```bash
# To verify a GitHub username exists:
curl -s https://api.github.com/users/USERNAME

# Example response for valid user:
{
  "login": "octocat",
  "id": 1,
  "type": "User"
}
```

**Case Sensitivity:**
- GitHub usernames are case-insensitive
- Configuration is case-sensitive in the workflow
- Use exact casing from GitHub profile

### Configuration Testing

#### 1. Test Authorized User Access

**Scenario**: Test PPR manual override
```bash
# Manual deployment as authorized user
gh workflow run deploy.yml \
  --ref any-branch \
  -f environment=ppr \
  -f override_branch_validation=true \
  -f deploy_notes="Testing authorized access"
```

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Deployment proceeds with authorization message

#### 2. Test Unauthorized User Access

**Scenario**: Non-authorized user attempts PPR override
```bash
# Manual deployment as non-authorized user
gh workflow run deploy.yml \
  --ref any-branch \
  -f environment=ppr \
  -f override_branch_validation=true
```

**Expected Result**: ‚ùå Deployment blocked with authorization error

#### 3. Test PROD Emergency Access

**Scenario**: Test emergency PROD deployment
```bash
# Emergency PROD deployment
gh workflow run deploy.yml \
  --ref any-branch \
  -f environment=prod \
  -f override_branch_validation=true \
  -f emergency_deployment=true \
  -f deploy_notes="Critical security patch deployment"
```

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Deployment proceeds with emergency warning logs

### Common Configuration Errors

#### 1. Syntax Errors

**Incorrect Formatting:**
```bash
# ‚ùå Spaces around commas
AUTHORIZED_USERS="admin, devops-lead, release-manager"

# ‚ùå Extra quotes
AUTHORIZED_USERS="'admin','devops-lead','release-manager'"

# ‚ùå Missing quotes
AUTHORIZED_USERS=admin,devops-lead,release-manager

# ‚úÖ Correct format
AUTHORIZED_USERS="admin,devops-lead,release-manager"
```

#### 2. Username Errors

**Common Mistakes:**
```bash
# ‚ùå Using email instead of username
AUTHORIZED_USERS="john@company.com"

# ‚ùå Using display name
AUTHORIZED_USERS="John Doe"

# ‚ùå Incorrect casing (if user is actually 'JohnDoe')
AUTHORIZED_USERS="johndoe"

# ‚úÖ Correct GitHub username
AUTHORIZED_USERS="JohnDoe"
```

### Audit and Monitoring

#### 1. Deployment Logs

All authorization attempts are logged:

```
‚úÖ User 'admin' authorized for PPR manual override
‚ùå User 'unauthorized-dev' blocked from PPR manual override
üö® EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT: User=admin, Notes='Critical patch'
```

#### 2. Regular Audits

**Monthly Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Review authorized users list
- [ ] Verify all users are still active team members
- [ ] Check for any unauthorized deployment attempts
- [ ] Update user list based on team changes

#### 3. Security Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Number of manual overrides per month
- Emergency deployments frequency
- Blocked deployment attempts
- User authorization failures

### Advanced Configuration Options

#### 1. Environment-Specific Authorization

For more granular control, you could extend the configuration:

```bash
# Future enhancement: Environment-specific users
PPR_AUTHORIZED_USERS="devops-lead,release-manager"
PROD_AUTHORIZED_USERS="admin,platform-engineer"
```

#### 2. Time-Based Restrictions

```bash
# Future enhancement: Time-based access
BUSINESS_HOURS_ONLY="true"
WEEKEND_DEPLOYMENTS="emergency-only"
```

#### 3. Integration with External Systems

```bash
# Future enhancement: External authorization
AUTH_SYSTEM="okta"
AUTH_GROUP="production-deployers"
```

## Protection Levels

### Standard Protection (DEV, SQE)
- **Auto-deployment**: Based on branch triggers
- **Manual Override**: No restrictions
- **User Requirements**: Any team member
- **Audit Level**: Basic logging

### Enhanced Protection (PPR)
- **Auto-deployment**: `release/**` branches only
- **Manual Override**: Authorized users only
- **User Requirements**: Must be in `AUTHORIZED_USERS` list
- **Audit Level**: Enhanced logging with user identification

### Maximum Protection (PROD)
- **Auto-deployment**: Tagged releases only
- **Manual Override**: Authorized users + emergency flag
- **User Requirements**: Must be in `AUTHORIZED_USERS` list AND set `emergency_deployment=true`
- **Audit Level**: Maximum logging with emergency alerts

## Emergency Deployment Procedures

### When to Use Emergency Deployment

**Valid Emergency Scenarios:**
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Production outages requiring immediate fixes
- Data corruption issues
- Compliance-related urgent updates

**Process:**
1. Assess if it's truly an emergency
2. Ensure you're an authorized user
3. Prepare detailed deployment notes
4. Set `emergency_deployment=true`
5. Monitor deployment closely
6. Document post-deployment actions

### Emergency Deployment Example

```yaml
# Manual workflow dispatch for emergency PROD deployment
environment: prod
override_branch_validation: true
emergency_deployment: true
custom_image_tag: "hotfix-security-patch-v1.2.3"
deploy_notes: "EMERGENCY: Critical security patch for CVE-2024-XXXX. Approved by security team. Rollback plan: revert to v1.2.2 tag."
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Access Management
- Limit authorized users to essential personnel only
- Regular review and cleanup of user list
- Document reasons for each authorized user

### 2. Emergency Procedures
- Clear escalation path for emergencies
- Pre-approved emergency contact list
- Post-deployment review process

### 3. Audit and Compliance
- Monitor all deployment activities
- Maintain deployment logs for compliance
- Regular security reviews of access patterns

### 4. Documentation
- Keep authorization list updated
- Document emergency procedures
- Train team on security protocols

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"User not authorized" Error:**
1. Verify GitHub username spelling
2. Check if user is in `AUTHORIZED_USERS` list
3. Ensure correct casing of username

**Emergency Deployment Blocked:**
1. Verify user is authorized
2. Ensure `emergency_deployment=true` is set
3. Check if deployment notes are provided

**Configuration Not Taking Effect:**
1. Verify changes are committed to correct branch
2. Check workflow file syntax
3. Ensure latest shared workflow version is being used
