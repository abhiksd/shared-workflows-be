# Composite Actions & Marketplace Integration - Complete Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the refactored CI/CD pipeline that now uses composite actions and marketplace integrations for better maintainability, reusability, and industry-standard security scanning.

## 🚀 What Was Accomplished

The original monolithic pipeline has been completely refactored into a modular, enterprise-grade system that leverages:
- **4 Custom Composite Actions** for reusable components
- **6 Marketplace Actions** for industry-standard tools
- **Enhanced Security Scanning** with 5 different security tools
- **Policy-as-Code** validation with OPA Rego
- **Comprehensive Reporting** with detailed PR feedback
