# Emergency Security Scan Bypass Guide

## üö® Overview

The Emergency Security Scan Bypass feature allows DevOps teams to temporarily bypass SonarQube and Checkmarx security scans during critical emergency deployments. This feature provides necessary flexibility while maintaining strict authorization controls and comprehensive audit trails.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice

**WARNING**: This feature bypasses critical security controls and should only be used for genuine emergencies. Improper use can introduce security vulnerabilities into production systems.

### When to Use Emergency Bypass

‚úÖ **Appropriate Use Cases:**
- Critical security patches requiring immediate deployment
- Production outages blocking business operations
- Hot fixes for data corruption issues
- Compliance-mandated urgent updates
- Service disruptions requiring immediate resolution

‚ùå **Inappropriate Use Cases:**
- Routine deployment delays
- Failed scans due to code quality issues
- Time pressure from business deadlines
- Developer convenience
- Avoiding scan remediation work

## üîß How It Works

### Repository Variables Control

The emergency bypass is controlled through GitHub repository variables that can be set by authorized DevOps team members:

- `EMERGENCY_BYPASS_SONAR`: Controls SonarQube scan bypass
- `EMERGENCY_BYPASS_CHECKMARX`: Controls Checkmarx scan bypass

### Authorization Levels

1. **Repository Variable Management**: DevOps team members with repository admin access
2. **Deployment Authorization**: Authorized users defined in the workflow
3. **Audit Trail**: All bypass activities are logged for compliance

## üìã Step-by-Step Emergency Bypass Process

### Step 1: Assess Emergency Situation

**Confirm Genuine Emergency:**
- Document the critical issue requiring bypass
- Verify business impact and urgency
- Confirm no alternative solutions exist
- Get stakeholder approval if required

### Step 2: Enable Emergency Bypass

**Navigate to Repository Variables:**
```
GitHub Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Variables tab
```

**Add Repository Variables:**

**For SonarQube Bypass:**
```
Variable Name: EMERGENCY_BYPASS_SONAR
Variable Value: true
```

**For Checkmarx Bypass:**
```
Variable Name: EMERGENCY_BYPASS_CHECKMARX  
Variable Value: true
```

### Step 3: Deploy with Emergency Bypass

**Trigger Deployment:**
```bash
# Manual deployment with emergency bypass enabled
gh workflow run deploy.yml \
  -f environment=prod \
  -f override_branch_validation=true \
  -f emergency_deployment=true \
  -f deploy_notes="EMERGENCY: Critical security patch - CVE-2024-XXXX. Bypass approved by security team."
```

**Verify Bypass Activation:**
- Check workflow logs for bypass confirmation messages
- Confirm scans are skipped and marked as "BYPASSED"
- Verify deployment proceeds despite bypass

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Actions (CRITICAL)

**Immediate Actions (Within 1 Hour):**
1. **Disable Bypass Variables**:
   - Delete `EMERGENCY_BYPASS_SONAR` variable
   - Delete `EMERGENCY_BYPASS_CHECKMARX` variable

2. **Document Emergency**:
   - Record bypass justification
   - Document business impact
   - Note approval chain

**Within 24 Hours:**
3. **Conduct Manual Security Review**:
   - Review deployed code changes
   - Perform manual security assessment
   - Validate emergency fix effectiveness

4. **Schedule Retroactive Scans**:
   - Run SonarQube scan on deployed code
   - Execute Checkmarx security scan
   - Address any identified issues

**Within 1 Week:**
5. **Process Review**:
   - Review emergency process effectiveness
   - Identify process improvements
   - Update emergency procedures if needed

## üîç Emergency Bypass Behavior

### SonarQube Bypass

**Normal Flow:**
```
SonarQube Scan ‚Üí Quality Gate Validation ‚Üí Build Process
```

**Emergency Bypass Flow:**
```
SonarQube Bypass Check ‚Üí Skip Scan ‚Üí Mark as BYPASSED ‚Üí Build Process
```

**Repository Variable Check:**
```yaml
- name: SonarQube Scan
  if: vars.EMERGENCY_BYPASS_SONAR != 'true'
  # Scan only runs if bypass variable is not set to 'true'
```

### Checkmarx Bypass

**Normal Flow:**
```
Checkmarx Scan ‚Üí Security Validation ‚Üí Build Process
```

**Emergency Bypass Flow:**
```
Checkmarx Bypass Check ‚Üí Skip Scan ‚Üí Mark as BYPASSED ‚Üí Build Process
```

**Repository Variable Check:**
```yaml
- name: Checkmarx Scan
  if: vars.EMERGENCY_BYPASS_CHECKMARX != 'true'
  # Scan only runs if bypass variable is not set to 'true'
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Authorization and Security Controls

### Multi-Layer Authorization

#### Layer 1: Repository Variable Access
- **Required**: Repository admin or maintain permissions
- **Purpose**: Control who can enable/disable bypass
- **Verification**: GitHub audit logs

#### Layer 2: Deployment Authorization  
- **Required**: User in authorized users list
- **Purpose**: Control who can perform deployments
- **Verification**: Workflow authorization check

#### Layer 3: Emergency Flag (PROD only)
- **Required**: `emergency_deployment=true` for production
- **Purpose**: Explicit emergency declaration
- **Verification**: Production approval gate

### Authorization Matrix

| Action | Repository Admin | Authorized User | Regular User |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Set Bypass Variables** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| **Deploy with Bypass** | ‚úÖ (if in auth list) | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| **View Bypass Status** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Audit Trail Access** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
