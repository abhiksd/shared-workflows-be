      dockerfile_path: ./Dockerfile
      helm_chart_path: ./helm
      aks_cluster_name_dev: ${{ vars.AKS_CLUSTER_NAME_DEV }}
      aks_resource_group_dev: ${{ vars.AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP_DEV }}

1. Create a feature branch in this repository
2. Make necessary changes to workflows or actions
3. Test changes with a service repository
4. Create pull request with detailed description
5. After approval and merge, service repositories automatically use the updated workflows

### Version Management
- **main branch**: Latest stable version (recommended for production)
- **develop branch**: Development version (for testing new features)
- **Version tags**: Specific stable versions (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0)

### Best Practices
- Always test workflow changes with a development service first
- Use semantic versioning for major changes
- Document breaking changes in release notes
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Workflow Monitoring
- All workflows include comprehensive logging
- Metrics collection for deployment success rates
- Integration with monitoring systems
- Slack/Teams notifications for failures

### Security Monitoring
- Automated security scanning on all workflows
- Vulnerability tracking and reporting
- Compliance checking and enforcement
- Regular security audits

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Workflow Not Found
```
Error: workflow not found: shared-deploy.yml
```
**Solution**: Ensure the workflow reference points to the correct repository and branch:
```yaml
uses: your-org/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/shared-deploy.yml@main
```

#### Permission Denied
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```
**Solution**: Check that the calling repository has access to this shared workflows repository and all required secrets are configured.

#### Build Failures
```
Error: Maven build failed
```
**Solution**: Check the Maven build logs in the workflow run details. Common issues:
- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect Java version
- Test failures
