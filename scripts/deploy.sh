  sqe       System Quality Engineering (rolling deployment)  
  ppr       Pre-production (rolling deployment)
  prod      Production (Blue-Green + Canary deployment)

Options:
  FORCE_DEPLOY  true/false - Deploy even if no changes detected (default: false)

Examples:
  $0 dev                    # Deploy to development
  $0 prod                   # Deploy to production with Blue-Green

  $0 --help                 # Show this help

Prerequisites:
  - GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated
  - Git repository with proper branches/tags
  - Access to GitHub Actions workflows

Environment Strategy:
  dev  ‚Üê develop branch (automatic)
  sqe  ‚Üê main branch (automatic)
  ppr  ‚Üê release/* branches (automatic)
  prod ‚Üê tags (manual approval + Blue-Green)
