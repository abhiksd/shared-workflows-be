# Shared GitHub Actions Workflows

This branch contains centralized, reusable GitHub Actions workflows and composite actions for all services in this repository.

## üéØ Purpose

- **Centralized CI/CD**: Consistent deployment patterns across all services
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Update workflows in one place, benefit everywhere  
- **Security Standards**: Enforce security scanning and compliance
- **Simplified Operations**: Streamlined workflows for faster development and testing
- **Best Practices**: Ensure all services follow the same patterns

## üöÄ Usage in Service Branches

Services reference these workflows from their own branches:

```yaml
# In service branch .github/workflows/deploy.yml
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/shared-deploy.yml@no-keyvault-shared-github-actions
    with:
      environment: dev
      application_name: my-service
      application_type: java-springboot
      build_context: .
      dockerfile_path: ./Dockerfile
      helm_chart_path: ./helm
```

## üìã Available Workflows

### shared-deploy.yml (Simplified)
Streamlined CI/CD pipeline for Java Spring Boot applications:
- Multi-environment deployment (dev, sqe, ppr, prod)
- Environment-specific branch strategies (dev/sqe branches, release/**, tags)
- Maven build with caching
- Docker build and push to Azure Container Registry
- Helm deployment to AKS clusters
- Quality gates (SonarQube, Checkmarx) with emergency bypass capability
- Spring Boot profile-based configuration management
- Kubernetes-native secret management
- Rolling update deployment strategy
- Manual deployment with branch override capabilities

### Environment Deployment Strategy
| Environment | Trigger | Branch/Tag Pattern | AKS Cluster |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **DEV** | Auto + Manual | `dev`, `develop` | `aks-dev-cluster` |
| **SQE** | Auto + Manual | `sqe` | `aks-sqe-cluster` |
| **PPR** | Auto + Manual | `release/**` | `aks-preprod-cluster` |
| **PROD** | Auto + Manual | `tags` | `aks-prod-cluster` |

### Manual Deployment Options

#### **Standard Deployment (Authorized Branches)**
```bash
# Deploy to DEV from dev branch (no override needed)
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=dev

# Deploy to PROD from tag (no override needed)  
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=prod
```

#### **Override Deployment (Any Branch)**
```bash
# Deploy to DEV from any branch with override
gh workflow run deploy.yml \
  -f environment=dev \
  -f override_branch_validation=true \
  -f deploy_notes="Testing feature branch deployment"

# Deploy to PROD from any branch with override (CRITICAL)
gh workflow run deploy.yml \
  -f environment=prod \
  -f override_branch_validation=true \
  -f deploy_notes="Emergency hotfix - approved by incident commander"
```

#### **Branch Validation Rules**
- **DEV/SQE**: Manual deployments from wrong branch **require override**
- **PPR**: Manual deployments from non-release branch **require override**  
- **PROD**: Manual deployments from non-tag **require override**
- **Override Usage**: Logged with user attribution for audit compliance

#### **Emergency Security Bypass** (Repository Level)
```bash
# Temporarily bypass security scans (use with extreme caution)
gh variable set EMERGENCY_BYPASS_SONAR --body "true"
gh variable set EMERGENCY_BYPASS_CHECKMARX --body "true"
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=prod
# Remember to remove after deployment
gh variable delete EMERGENCY_BYPASS_SONAR
gh variable delete EMERGENCY_BYPASS_CHECKMARX
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **For New Services**: Copy the deployment workflow from an existing service branch
2. **For Existing Services**: Update workflow reference to use this branch
3. **For Testing**: Use manual deployment with override capabilities
4. **For Emergencies**: Set repository variables for quality gate bypass

## üîç Troubleshooting

- Check workflow runs: `gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml`
- View specific run: `gh run view <run-id>`
- Manual deployment: `gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=dev`
- For detailed commands and troubleshooting, see the [Command Reference Guide](../../../no-keyvault-my-app/COMMAND_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md)
